README File for the Execution of Item-Item Similarity Algorithm on Epinion Dataset.

1.The Item-Item Similarity Algorithm is implemented in Java programming language so you need a Java Runtime Environment.
2. Place the trainingdataepinion.txt, validationdataepinion.txt and testingdataepinion.txt files which are provided in the same folder as that of recproject1.java
3. On command line, specify the path of JRE to the folder which contains recproject1.
5. javac is used to compile the code and java is used to run the code.

Inputs and the format it is taken in:
1. K (Top K un purchased items)  Format: command line integer value
2. N (Top N recommended items) Format: command line integer value

Commands to type for Running the Program:
1. javac recproject1.java
2. java recproject1

Example: (K=30, N=30)
1. The trainingdataepinion.txt, validationdataepinion.txt and testingdataepinion.txt files must be in the same folder as that of the recproject1.java file.
2. Open (command prompt)cmd and set the path in the folder itemsimmethod to (location where Java is installed)/Java/jdk(version)/bin and press Enter.
3. Type javac recproject1.java and press Enter.
4. Type java recproject1 and press Enter.
5. The program will output k=0, k=500.... till k=139500(starts from zero) which shows that the transpose of 140000 items has been done. It is used as a counter purpose to know when the CSR Transpose is done. It will go till 139500 and when 140000th item is reached it will ask for the K value. This step takes around 3 minutes.
6. The program will ask for K value in which 30 has to be typed in cmd and press Enter. 
7. The program will then ask for N value in which 30 has to be typed in cmd and press Enter.
9. The program will then calculate the Item-Item Similarities of all items wrt to each item and it will take around 1 hour. The values i=0,i=500,... till i=139500(starts from zero) will be output on the console. It is used as a counter purpose to know when the Item-Item Similarities is done. It will go till 139500 and when 140000th item is reached it will start with the candidate set generation for each user.
10. The candidate set generation will start from c=0,c=500,... till c=40000(starts from zero for 40163 users) will be output on the console. It is used as a counter purpose to know when the candidate set generation is done. This step takes around 2 minutes.
8. The program will then output the HR and ARHR values at the end of program execution.


Note: 
1. You can try different combinations of K and N.
2. The validationdataepinion is not used in Item-Item Similarity Method.
3. The itemsimresults folder contains the results for the combinations of K=10,N=10; K=20,N=10; K=20,N=15; K=20,N=20; K=25,N=15; K=25,N=25; K=30,N=15; K=30,N=20 and K=30,N=30.

Meaning of Output and It's Interpretation:
1. The result is good if the HR and ARHR values are increasing for increasing values of K and N.
2. When K which is the top un purchased items is increased and N which is the top recommended items is increased then the value of the Hit Rate(HR) and Average Reciprocal Hit Rate(ARHR) if it increases the algorithm is working correctly.
3. The Hit Rate gives us an idea of the efficiency of the recommendations by a particular method in which the users who brought the items in the testing dataset match that of the recommended items in the top N recommended items generated by algorithm. High HR shows that our algorithm is effective in recommendations.
4. So as N increases along with K, the HR must increase.
5. The ARHR considers the index position at which the hit has happened. Hence, a high ARHR will show that the algorithm is very effective in recommendations.
6. The ARHR also should increase when the value of K and N is increased.
